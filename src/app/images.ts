From my personal company building websites to startups to Google Practicum Engineer, I have worked for all kinds of companies. Outside of programming, I am an active member of the Association of Computer Engineers where my graphic design can be seen all over the org's website. If I'm not behind a desk nerding out, you can catch me at the local skatepark trying to do some kickflips!"
